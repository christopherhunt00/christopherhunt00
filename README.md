## Hi there, I am Christopher Hunt 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on building my skills and portfolio to become a business analyst.

🌱 I’m currently learning Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, along with core concepts in data analytics and business intelligence.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects, case studies, or mock business problems to gain hands-on experience.

🤔 I’m looking for help with breaking into the tech/analytics industry and getting real-world practice.

💬 Ask me about Excel, PowerPoint, or anything related to business strategy and data analysis.
