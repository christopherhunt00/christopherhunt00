## Hi there, I am Christopher Hunt ðŸ‘‹

**christopherhunt00/christopherhunt00** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skills and portfolio to become a business analyst.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, along with core concepts in data analytics and business intelligence.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects, case studies, or mock business problems to gain hands-on experience.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with breaking into the tech/analytics industry and getting real-world practice.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Excel, PowerPoint, or anything related to business strategy and data analysis.
